Config Portal opens automatically or open IP: 192.168.4.1 in a browser (on the device you connected to the Board WiFi)

Now you can change your board settings (WiFi Network, Upload, Sensors, Timezone...)

If you use the Update Option:

>find the current compiled firmware for OTA upload (Board Setup on the Config Portal) here:
>[current Firmware](https://gitlab.com/teleagriculture/community/-/tree/main/teleAgriCulture%20Board%20V2.1/Firmware) version 1.02
>
>**If you are using LORA please choose the right Firmware for your location / lora module**
>and you have to enter your credentials for LoRa on the Config Portal

## Connect your data to the TeleAgriCulture Kits page

- first you need an account on the TeleAgiCulture page. Talk to our admin.
- log in to kits.teleagriculture.org
- click on your kit
- click on configure (Top Right)
- add Sensors, dont change the API-key or Kit-ID (we are sending data verified by this numbers)
- save your settings

**we dont send Sensor or data names. (names use a lot of bytes via Lora transmission)**
**So your Sensor names have to match whats shown on your board (e.g.: temp, temp1, temp2... hum, hum1, ...)**
